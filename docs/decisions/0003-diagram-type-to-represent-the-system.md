# Diagram type to represent the system

* Status: accepted
* Date: 2023-10-24

## Context and Problem Statement

Understanding the structure of the system is important for several reasons. It helps stakeholders to understand how components of the system are organised and how they interact. Therefore, a representation was needed for components of the system.

## Considered Options

* Class Diagram
* Package Diagram
* Component Diagram

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Class Diagram", because the problem has already been decomposed into classes so at this level of abstraction a class diagram is the most suitable representation.
